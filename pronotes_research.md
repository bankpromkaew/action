# ProNotes Research: How It Works and Can It Be Built?

## What is ProNotes?

**ProNotes** (https://www.pronotes.app/) is a macOS application that enhances Apple Notes with advanced features typically found in sophisticated note-taking apps like Notion or Obsidian. It's **not** an official Apple extension but rather a third-party app that integrates with Apple Notes at the system level.

### Key Features:
- **Formatting Bar**: Inline formatting options above selected text
- **Markdown Support**: Type `#`, `>`, `[]`, ```` for formatting
- **Slash Commands**: `/heading`, `/checklist`, `/table`, etc.
- **AI Integration**: Writing assistance, summarization, grammar fixing (ProNotes Gold)
- **Bi-directional Links**: Link between notes with backlinks
- **Templates**: Reusable content snippets
- **Command Palette**: ⌘+P to search notes
- **Copy as Markdown**: Export notes in markdown format

## How ProNotes Works as a "Plugin"

### Technical Architecture

ProNotes **does not use official Apple Notes extension APIs** because Apple Notes doesn't provide public extension APIs. Instead, it uses several macOS system-level technologies:

#### 1. **Accessibility APIs**
- Uses macOS `NSAccessibility` protocol to read and interact with Apple Notes UI elements
- Accesses the text content, selection state, and UI hierarchy
- Requires "Accessibility" permission in System Preferences

#### 2. **Keyboard Event Injection**
- Uses `CGEventCreateKeyboardEvent` and `CGEventPost` APIs
- Monitors keyboard input and injects enhanced functionality
- Converts shortcuts like `/heading` into formatted text

#### 3. **Input Monitoring**
- Uses `CGEventTap` or `NSEvent` global monitoring
- Detects when user types special sequences (slash commands, markdown syntax)
- Requires "Input Monitoring" permission on macOS 10.15+

#### 4. **UI Overlays**
- Creates floating windows/panels that appear over Apple Notes
- Provides formatting bar, command palette, and other UI enhancements
- Uses `NSWindow` with special window levels

#### 5. **Application Integration**
- Monitors when Apple Notes is active/inactive
- Only functions when Notes app is in focus
- Uses app state notifications and window management APIs

### Permission Requirements

ProNotes requires several macOS permissions:

1. **Accessibility Access**: To read Notes content and UI state
2. **Input Monitoring**: To capture keyboard events (macOS 10.15+)
3. **Full Disk Access**: For some advanced features (mentioned in user discussions)

## Can ProNotes Be Built? **YES!**

### Technical Feasibility: ✅ Completely Possible

The technical approaches ProNotes uses are well-documented and available to any macOS developer:

#### Available Technologies:
1. **CGEvent APIs**: For keyboard event creation and injection
2. **NSAccessibility**: For reading/interacting with other apps' UI
3. **NSEvent Global Monitoring**: For system-wide input detection
4. **NSWindow Overlays**: For custom UI elements
5. **AppleScript/NSWorkspace**: For app state monitoring

#### Example Implementation Approaches:

**1. Keyboard Automation:**
```objc
// Create keyboard event
CGEventRef event = CGEventCreateKeyboardEvent(NULL, kVK_Space, true);
// Post to system
CGEventPost(kCGHIDEventTap, event);
CFRelease(event);
```

**2. Global Input Monitoring:**
```objc
[NSEvent addGlobalMonitorForEventsMatchingMask:NSEventMaskKeyDown 
                                       handler:^(NSEvent *event) {
    // Process keyboard input
}];
```

**3. Accessibility Integration:**
```objc
// Get frontmost app's UI elements
AXUIElementRef app = AXUIElementCreateApplication(pid);
// Access text fields, buttons, etc.
```

### Development Requirements:

#### Technical Skills Needed:
- **Objective-C/Swift**: For macOS app development
- **Cocoa/AppKit**: For UI and system integration
- **Core Graphics**: For event handling
- **Accessibility APIs**: For Notes integration
- **Code Signing**: For distribution outside App Store

#### Development Tools:
- **Xcode**: Apple's development environment
- **macOS SDK**: System frameworks and APIs
- **Accessibility Inspector**: For debugging accessibility integration

#### Challenges & Considerations:

**1. Security Restrictions:**
- Users must grant multiple permissions
- Increasingly strict security in newer macOS versions
- Cannot distribute through Mac App Store (uses private APIs)

**2. Apple Compatibility:**
- No official API means breakage risk with OS updates
- Apple could potentially block this approach in future
- Needs testing across different macOS versions

**3. User Experience:**
- Must feel native and responsive
- Complex coordinate calculations for UI overlays
- Memory and performance optimization

## Similar Existing Projects

### Open Source Examples:
1. **Keyboard Automation**: Multiple GitHub repos show CGEvent usage
2. **Input Monitoring**: Event tap examples available
3. **Accessibility**: Screen reader and automation tools

### Commercial Alternatives:
1. **Keyboard Maestro**: Advanced automation tool
2. **Alfred**: Productivity app with similar features
3. **Raycast**: Modern launcher with extensibility

## Implementation Roadmap

If building a ProNotes alternative:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Set up basic macOS app project
2. Implement accessibility permission handling
3. Create basic Apple Notes detection
4. Build keyboard event injection system

### Phase 2: Basic Features
1. Markdown syntax detection and conversion
2. Simple slash command system
3. Basic formatting bar overlay

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. AI integration (OpenAI API)
2. Note linking and backlinks
3. Template system
4. Command palette

### Phase 4: Polish & Distribution
1. User interface refinement
2. Performance optimization
3. Code signing and notarization
4. Distribution outside App Store

## Conclusion

**ProNotes can absolutely be built** using documented macOS APIs and techniques. The core functionality relies on:

- **Accessibility APIs** for Apple Notes integration
- **Keyboard automation** for enhanced input handling  
- **UI overlays** for additional interface elements
- **Input monitoring** for detecting special sequences

While challenging due to security restrictions and lack of official APIs, the technical approach is sound and proven. Multiple developers have successfully created similar tools, and the necessary APIs are stable and well-documented.

The main considerations are:
- **Security permissions** users must grant
- **Compatibility** with future macOS versions
- **Distribution** outside the Mac App Store
- **User experience** quality and performance

For developers interested in building this, the technology exists and examples are available - it's primarily a matter of implementation effort and attention to user experience details.
